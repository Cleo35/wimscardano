## Notice

Please read the following notice carefully before proceeding to read this Whitepaper issued by Women In Move Solutions (Pty) Ltd, a company incorporated and existing under the laws of South Africa (hereinafter referred to as the "Distributor"). This notice applies to all persons who read this document. Please note that this notice may be altered or updated.

The Whitepaper does not constitute any relations between you (hereinafter referred to as "you" or "Holder") and the Distributor. Women In Move Solutions will be referred to as WIMS. Acquiring WIMT / WIM tokens/coins or participating in WIMS business activities constitutes acceptance of WIMS Terms and Conditions (hereinafter referred to as "T&C").

## Regulatory Compliance

Different countries have different regulations and requirements for their citizens regarding crypto and blockchain industry activities such as Bitcoin, trading, exchanges, Smart Contracts, DAO, Distributed Applications (dApps), and similar activities.

## WIMS Objectives

WIMS is a collection of various traditional business activities, blockchain, and crypto ventures aimed at empowering and protecting women worldwide. As such, individuals from various countries can participate in these activities, as not all are prohibited in all countries. This is supported by the fact that UN Women are embracing blockchain technology.

### Why Not Focus on a Single Project?

We aim to:

- Eliminate investment risk created by volatile crypto assets
- Offer various choices to women
- Create a self-reliant and self-sustaining ecosystem

One of WIMSâ€™s objectives is to assist UN Women in their search for blockchain solutions that will help women. 

### Complaints and Inquiries

Any complaints, criticism, inquiries, or questions relating to legal or compliance matters must be sent in writing to [legal@wims.io](mailto:legal@wims.io).

## Division Operations

This document does not provide details on how each venture of WIMS will operate. Each division will publish their own sub-white papers and mini-business plans, detailing their operations, budgets, and auditing deliverables. Remember, the Bitcoin White Paper was not more than 15 pages, and it is not necessary to convert a white paper into a fully detailed business plan.

## Executive Summary

In the last nine years, from 2009 until 2018, we have seen the rise of blockchain businesses worldwide, with a significant gender gap. According to Kelsey Cole (2018), "Only 4-6% of Blockchain and cryptocurrency participants are female."

The problem of the lack of substantial participation of women in the blockchain industry is so acute that a simple search for females vs males in blockchain on the internet brings up many shocking articles.

### Active Leadership

You might note that the active legal director of the incorporated WIMS is a male, Bernard Sibanda. He is merely a facilitator, caretaker, and coordinator whose role is to release all shares to the rightful powerful women bred by the activities of WIMS. The goal is to have 196 active women visionary directors, each representing one of the 196 countries of the world. If this fails, then the entire WIMS initiative is a farce.
